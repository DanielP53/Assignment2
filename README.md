# Assignment 2

Where is the Party (WIP) is a application for mobile that I developed as a student.

## Purpose
The purpose of this app is to find partys of friends and public places that are close to the current location. With just the push of a button it will open Google Maps with the route to get to the location.

The user can also publish partys, with pictures and the attendees are able to rate the party.

## Requirements

Nodejs 12
Flutter 2.8

## Contributing
At the time only the owner and friends can collaborate, but in the future Pull requests will be wellcome.
